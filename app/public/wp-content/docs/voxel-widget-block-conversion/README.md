# Widget to Block Conversion - Screenshots

Reference screenshots documenting the conversion of Voxel Elementor widgets to Gutenberg blocks.

## Purpose

These screenshots show the original Voxel widget UI and behavior to help maintain feature parity when converting to FSE blocks.

## Screenshots

- Edit post interface showing widget placement
- Template editor views
- Various widget configurations and states
- Block editor integration examples

## Status

Most screenshots are historical references from the widget conversion phase. The project has since moved to a **full child theme approach** (voxel-fse) following Voxel's "everything in the theme" philosophy.
