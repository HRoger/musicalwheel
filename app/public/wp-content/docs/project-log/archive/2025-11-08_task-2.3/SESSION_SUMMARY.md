## Next Task

## Deferred Enhancements (Phase 2 / backlog)
1. Convert server-rendered Timeline placeholder into a richer PHP template that renders real timeline UI.  
2. Wire editor/preview to fetch live GraphQL data for a closer WYSIWYG preview (use wp.apiFetch or a client-side GraphQL fetch).  
3. Add unit/integration tests for `Block_Loader` behavior (auto-discovery, registration, HMR detection).  
4. Improve dev-server detection/config:
   - Increase transient TTL or make health-check configurable (dev flag)
   - Optionally externalize `@wordpress/*` in Vite config or pre-bundle deps

## Notes
- All session documentation files moved to `app/public/wp-content/docs/project-log/2025-11-08_task-2.3/`.  
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/README.md` were updated to reference the project-log.  
- Theme root cleaned of session docs (moved into project-log).

## Completion
This session is complete and Task 2.3 is closed. Ready to start Task 3.1.
