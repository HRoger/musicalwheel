## Archive

Outdated planning documents are stored in `archive/`:
- `AI_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v3.9.md` - Original headless WordPress build-from-scratch plan (superseded by current architecture)
- `LOCAL_BY_FLYWHEEL_GIT_STRUCTURE.md` - Git workflow reference

These documents represent earlier planning approaches before the architecture consolidation. They're preserved for historical reference but don't reflect the current development strategy.
